Expressed in cotyledons and leaves. Mutants display de-etiolation and derepression of light-induced genes in the dark, dwarfism, male sterility and activation of stress-regulated genes in the light. The expression of the gene using a CPD promoter:LUC fusion construct was shown to be under circadian and light control. Additionally, the circadian regulation was shown to be independent of BR levels as it remains unchanged in <i>bri1</i> mutant lines. CPD appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through a BRI1-mediated signaling pathway that affects FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses."

About 10-20% of mutants also have defects in ovules. Mutants have reduced fertility most likely as because of fusions that pistil emergence. The protein has similarity to the mandelonitrile lyase family of FAD containing oxidoreductases and is predicted to be secreted (SignalP).It is expressed in all tissue layers of roots, inflorescences, stems, leaves, and flowers and is also expressed in siliques. Expression is highest in inflorescence and flower tissue.Transmission of mutant alleles to the progeny shows non mendelian segregation- a percentage of mutant alleles revert back to a previous parental (e.g. grandparental) wild type allele. It has been suggested that an RNA template driven or other extra-DNA genomic mechanism may be responsible for the non-mendelian inheritance of HTH. Reversion events in alleles at other loci have also been observed to occur in plants with an hth mutant background indicating a genome wide effect."

This protein has an N-terminal PHD domain and two RING domains surrounding an SRA domain. The protein has been shown to bind to methylated cytosines of CG, CNG and CNN motifs via its SRA domain but has a preference for the former. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in vitro with members of the UBC8 family E2s. Either of the two RING domains present in the protein can promote ubiquitylation in vitro, but, not the PHD domain. Over-expression of ORTH1/VIM3 leads to decreased levels of FWA methylation, increased levels of FWA transcripts, and delayed flowering.

The HDS enzyme controls the penultimate steps of the biosynthesis of IPP and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) via the MEP pathway and may serve as a metabolic control point for SA-mediated disease resistance. In the light, the electrons required for the reaction catalyzed by HDS are directly provided by the electron flow from photosynthesis via ferredoxin. In the dark however, the enzyme requires an electron shuttle: ferredoxin-NADP<sup>+</sup> reductase. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile."

The protein contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), followed by a highly conserved amino-terminal domain (N) shared by all family members, a BIN2 phosphorylation domain (P), a PEST motif, involved in protein degradation in the absence of BR, and a carboxyl-terminal domain. BES1 can interact with the ELF6 and REF6 Jumonji N/C-domain containing proteins and may direct them to modify histone methylation upstream of some brassinosteroid responsive-genes.

ATMLO11 belongs to the clade I, with AtMLO4 and AtMLO14. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth (in primary root), in root tips and lateral root primordia, and in very young leaves, and in flowers and fruit abscission zone, as shown by GUS activity patterns.

Members of this family include: At5g60810 (RGF1), At1g13620 (RGF2), At2g04025 (RGF3), At3g30350 (RGF4), At5g51451 (RGF5), At4g16515 (RGF6), At3g02240 (RGF7), At2g03830 (RGF8) and At5g64770 (RGF9)."

It was first identified in a screen for genes with altered expression pattern in SS3 mutants which make an abundance of starch. Overexpression of QQS in Arabidopsis increases protein content and decreases total starch content. Thus it appears to function to modulate carbon/nitrogen allocation in Arabidopsis. Over expression of QQS in soybean, rice and maize also results in an increase in protein and decrease in starch levels suggesting that QQS affects similar pathways in a wide range of plants. QQS interacts with NF-YC4 in Arabidopsis and NF-YC4 homologs in rice, soybean and maize. In Arabidopsis QQS is localized the the cytoplasm and when complexed with NF-YC4 , it localizes to the nucleus."

The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in primary root and lateral root primordia, in fruit abscission zone, in vascular system of cotyledons and in trichomes of young leaves,; it was not expressed in mature rosette leaves, as shown by GUS activity patterns.
